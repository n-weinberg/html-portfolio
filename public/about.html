<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Naty, and my professional journey has been shaped by a mix of diverse experiences. 
  I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Business Administration with an emphasis on International Business, and throughout my career, 
  I’ve worked as a recruitment marketing and employer brand specialist, as well as an internal communications consultant. 
  I’ve also spent time at a board games store, where I had the chance to host game night events. 
  Currently, I’m studying web development, as I’m always curious about data, human behavior, and how storytelling can 
  connect people. I’m passionate about diversity, inclusion, and sustainability, and I feel inspired to work in a global 
  environment where I can meet people from different cultures and backgrounds.</p>

<p>When I’m not working or studying, I enjoy a variety of activities that keep me both entertained and grounded. 
  I love playing board games and computer games, as well as watching TV shows and anime. I’m also really into helping 
  people organize their spaces by decluttering, which brings me a sense of satisfaction. Painting with watercolors has 
  become a way for me to express myself, especially when I’m feeling down, and I’m also getting back into reading, a hobby 
  I had when I was younger but drifted away from over the years. Cooking is another passion of mine, and I love preparing 
  meals for myself and others, though baking is not quite my thing (yet). I’m also planning to get back into practicing yoga to 
  take care of my well-being.</p>

<p>There are a few life milestones I’m particularly proud of, such as earning my scuba diving license and the fact that 
  I’ve been living on my own since I was 20. I think my friends and family would describe me as determined, emotional, but 
  also in control when it matters most. I’m always striving to grow, learn, and connect with others in meaningful ways, and 
  I hope to leave a positive impact on the world through my work and personal passions.</p>
